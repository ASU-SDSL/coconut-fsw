# Coconut Flight Software

This repo contains the flight software for the SDSL Coconut CubeSat. It uses FreeRTOS on the Raspberry Pi Pico. This repo is based on [this repo](https://github.com/smittytone/RP2040-FreeRTOS) so check it out for reference.

## Building

1. Install Docker üêã
2. Connect the board to your computer with a USB cable while holding the `BOOTSEL` button
   1. If you don't want to keep disconnecting and reconnecting the USB cable while testing code, the `RESET` button helps
3. Run `docker_deploy.sh` to build the firmware in Docker and deploy it to your board
   1. Run `docker_build.sh` if you'd just like to build your firmware without flashing it
   2. This may be the only way to build it on Windows. Then you can manually copy the firmware binary from the `docker_build` directory onto the RPI file system which will flash the firmware

## Debugging

For debugging, you have two options:
1. Debugging with GDB through SWD/JTAG
   1. Instructions needed
2. Printing to the debug terminal
   1. Call log_info, log_debug, etc. inside your function
   2. Connect the board to your computer with a USB cable
   3. Install and open PUTTY with admin privileges 
   4. Select the `serial` option and use these options:
      1. Serial line
         1. `/dev/ttyACM0` on Linux
         2. Probably some `COM` port on Windows, may need to check Device Manager or Google
      2. Speed
