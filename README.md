# RP2040-FreeRTOS Template 1.4.1

This repo contains the flight software for the Coconut CubeSat. It uses FreeRTOS on the Raspberry Pi Pico. This repo is based on [this repo](https://github.com/smittytone/RP2040-FreeRTOS) so check it out for reference.

## Instalation Instructions

These tools must be installed to compile and upload the code in this repo. Follow these steps:
1. In a directory of your choice, run - ```git clone -b master --recurse-submodules https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git```
2. In a directory of your choice, run - ```git clone https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel```
3. To map these directories to the appropriate envirnment variables, add these lines to your ```~/.bashrc``` file (note: the .bashrc file only runs when you login, so you will have to run these commands in your command line the first time):
    * ```export PICO_SDK_PATH="$HOME/Documents/coconut/freertos/pico-sdk"```
    * ```export FREERTOS_KERNEL_PATH="$HOME/Documents/coconut/freertos/FreeRTOS-Kernel"```
4. Clone this repository - ```git clone https://github.com/ASU-SDSL/coconut-fsw```
5. Install extra tools: ```sudo apt install cmake gcc-arm-none-eabi build-essential```

## Usage

1. Connect your device so itâ€™s ready for file transfer.
2. Build the project and transfer it to the Raspberry Pi Pico: `./deploy.sh -b -u`.
    * Just build the project: `./deploy.sh -b`
    * Just transfer the project: `./deploy.sh -u`

NOTE: if you get an error that the directory does not exist, change the `rpi_path` variable in the `deploy.sh` to your RPI's mounted file location.
